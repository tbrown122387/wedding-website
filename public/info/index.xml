 about an hour and fifteen minutes from Easton. between BWI and the Eastern Shore, you must cross the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (which is under construction and known for its traffic!) there is a shuttle between BWI and the Easton Airport (this is a very small airport, and does not offer commercial flights).    ILG (Wilmington)
 avoids the Bay Bridge, but may be a bit more expensive    </description>
