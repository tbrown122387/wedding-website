1. BWI (Baltimore)

    - about an hour and fifteen minutes from Easton. 
    - between BWI and the Eastern Shore, you must cross the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (which is under construction and known for its traffic!) 
    - there is a shuttle between BWI and the Easton Airport (this is a very small airport, and does not offer commercial flights). 

2. ILG (Wilmington)
    - avoids the Bay Bridge, but may be a bit more expensive
