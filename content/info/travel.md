1. Baltimore Airport (BWI)

    - about an hour and fifteen minutes from Easton. 
    - between BWI and the Eastern Shore, you must cross the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (which is under construction and known for its traffic!) 
    - the Bayrunner Shuttle runs between BWI and the Easton Airport (this is a very small airport, and does not offer commercial flights). 

2. Bayrunner Shuttle
    - one-way or round-trip shuttle service to BWI Marshall Airport, BWI MARC/Amtrak station or the Baltimore Greyhound bus station

3. Wilmington Airport (ILG)
    - avoids the Bay Bridge, but may be a bit more expensive
